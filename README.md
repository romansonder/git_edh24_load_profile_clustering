# Loadprofile Clustering Project

## Overview

Welcome to the loadprofile clustering project! This initiative is a collaborative effort, inspired by the 2024 Energy Data Hackdays (12.-13.9). Our goal is to leverage publicly available smart meter data 
to develop a robust solution for load profile clustering. The project is open to all interested participants and encourages contributions across organizations.

## Project Goals

- **Primary Objective**: Develop a solution for creating load profile clusters using publicly available smart meter data, such as the CKW Open Smart Meter Data.
- **Secondary Objectives**:
  - Determine optimal cluster sizes.
  - Visualize changes in load profiles over time.
  - Identify key features within each cluster.
  - Predict future changes in clusters.
  - Suggest methods for shifting consumers between clusters to optimize load distribution.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes publicly accessible data, primarily focusing on smart meter datasets. Participants are encouraged to contribute their own data, enhancing the projectâ€™s diversity and applicability.

## Collaboration

This project is a cross-organizational collaboration. We invite participants from various backgrounds to join forces, share insights, 
and contribute to developing a solution that benefits all involved parties. Whether you bring technical expertise, domain knowledge, or additional datasets, your participation is highly valued.
